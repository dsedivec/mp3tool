# mp3tool #

## Introduction

I've got a lot of MP3s that I've ripped/encoded/tagged with various
software over time.  This tool helps me ferret out weird tags or files
with errors in them.  It's fairly user-unfriendly, I suspect, and it
reflects my personal preferences.  It's also completely untested,
which is bad.

## Requirements

You'll need the MAD headers and libraries around.  I've gotten it from
MacPorts and on various Linux distros.
